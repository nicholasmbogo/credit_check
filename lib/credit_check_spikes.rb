  #double the number
  #if more than 10 add it together
  #If doubled number is more than 9, subtract 9. Then give back the number

  # if the numberis less than 10 then do nothing, give back the number.


#we split the credit card number using .chars, and saved it to a variable called slpit_number.

#split_number.each do = instructs ruby to do something to every value in split_number array
  # check if index is odd
  # if it is, mulitply by 2
   #change number at odd index to multiplied value.

   #Here we change the strings to an integer in order to run




 #here we sum up all the integers


#if added number is divisable by 10 then tell user its valid
#if added number is not divisable by 10, tell the user the card number is invalid.

# Your Luhn Algorithm Here

# Output
## If it is valid, print "The number is valid!"
## If it is invalid, print "The number is invalid!"
